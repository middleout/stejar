keep only:
    -intl
    -intl-react
    -react-reduce-components
    -router
    -router-browser
    -router-middleware
    -router-react
    -router-routes
    -router-server
add:
    -router-previous-state

MAYBE:
    move router stuff to a new package called "@stejar-router" ?
    move INTL stuff to a new package called "@stejar-intl" ?
    move the rest to a @stejar-helpers ?
